Monitor air quality with RasperryPi

The Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 require that concentrations of PM in the UK must not exceed:
* An annual average of 40 µg/m3 for PM10;
* A 24-hour average of 50 µg/m3 more than 35 times in a single year for PM10;
* An annual average of 20 µg/m3 for PM2.5.
